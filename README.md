# *Relation between air pollution, weather and traffic*

The goal is to predict the pollution in a particular point of a city for the next few hours. The prediction will take as input from the data collected by sensors of air pollution and number of vehicles. We will train different models and evaluate the results to choose the best predictions in each case.

## What is inside?

The project includes:

- Basic data management to prepare the data
- Basic statistics to understand the data and detect outliers
- Clustering for selecting days with similar pollution/traffic conditions
- Feature selection
- Hiperparameter tunning
- Model Selection
